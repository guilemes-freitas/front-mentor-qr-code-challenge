## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is a beginner challenge, and, although I have years of experience in the industry it should not be undermined, there is always something to improve, even in something
that you consider trivial to do. Don't forget the basics!

### Continued development

The main area that I would like to work on future projects is the SEO optimization, I don't feel that I have a complete understanding of it yet and it is my main concern at
the moment.

## Acknowledgments

In this challenge you have one container with a border-radius, and the content also, when in this situation the outer border should have a radius value equal to the value of
the inner-border PLUS the value of padding. Putting in a simpler way border-radius 24px, the outer border-radius = border-radius 12px, the image border-radius + padding 12px. It's a good rule to always remember in this situation.
